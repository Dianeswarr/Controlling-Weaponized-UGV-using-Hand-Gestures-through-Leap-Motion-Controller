Weaponized UGVâ€™s (unmanned ground vehicle) is used in the military for reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition missions. These UGVs can assassinate the enemy with heavy machine guns, grenade launchers and even anti-tank weapons. It is mostly remote-operated by one or two soldiers. Military UGVs use sensors and can respond automatically. But in July 2015, thousands of artificial intelligence signed a ban against the weaponized automated vehicle. But in this paper, weaponized UGV is controlled by hand gestures using the leap motion controller, making it a manual weaponized vehicle. There are several manually controlled UGVs such as remote-controlled and voice-controlled. In remote control, the user has to peep into the remote in search of the buttons. In voice-controlled, external noise may affect the performance of the system. But Leap Motion Controller (LMC) is a new three- dimensional touch-free device which introduces a new gesture and position tracking system with an excellent accuracy level, by using the leap motion controller, we can avoid external noise interference and making it is user-friendly device. Weaponized gesture-controlled UGV can be used to support or replace soldiers at the battlefield and can be used at terror attack where user can monitor and assassinate the subject without taking any damage on to him/her.
